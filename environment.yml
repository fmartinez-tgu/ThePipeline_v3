# Notes:
# - Singularity / Apptainer is not typically installed via conda; install it
#   via your system package manager following vendor docs if you need Minos
#   execution via containers.
# - The repo already includes some binaries under `Programs/`. The
#   `data/Paths/programs_path` file controls which binaries the pipeline will
#   use. Prefer those bundled binaries if you want an offline install.
