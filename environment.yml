# Notes:
# - GATK is not included here because the project repository removed the GATK jar
#   due to size and licensing; download GATK v4.2.5.0 manually from the GATK
#   website if you need Mutect2 support.
# - pairsnp is vendored in `data/libs/pairsnp-python/`. Installing the pip
#   entry above is optional if you prefer to use the bundled copy.
# - Singularity / Apptainer is not typically installed via conda; install it
#   via your system package manager following vendor docs if you need Minos
#   execution via containers.
# - The repo already includes some binaries under `Programs/`. The
#   `data/Paths/programs_path` file controls which binaries the pipeline will
#   use. Prefer those bundled binaries if you want an offline install.
