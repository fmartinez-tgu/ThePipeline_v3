Heavy files removed from workspace
=================================

This file lists files larger than 100MB that were present in the repository and have been removed from the workspace to reduce repository size. If you need any of these files for execution, download them from the original upstream sources and place them back under the same paths (or update `data/Paths/programs_path` accordingly).

List (size in MB, path):

- 1183.77 MB	/home/fran-martinez/Escritorio/ThePipeline_v3/ThePipeline_v3/Programs/Minos/minos_v0.12.5.img
  - Reason: Singularity image for Minos adjudication (huge container image). Re-download from the Minos release page or build the Singularity image from the Minos release if needed.

- 304.28 MB	/home/fran-martinez/Escritorio/ThePipeline_v3/ThePipeline_v3/Programs/gatk-4.2.5.0/gatk-package-4.2.5.0-local.jar
  - Reason: GATK jar distribution. This is a large binary; you can re-download from the Broad Institute GATK releases.

- 164.79 MB	/home/fran-martinez/Escritorio/ThePipeline_v3/ThePipeline_v3/Programs/gatk-4.2.5.0/gatk-package-4.2.5.0-spark.jar
  - Reason: GATK spark distribution jar. Re-download from the GATK release page if needed.

- 100.46 MB	/home/fran-martinez/Escritorio/ThePipeline_v3/ThePipeline_v3/Programs/snpEff/data/GRCh37.75/snpEffectPredictor.bin
  - Reason: snpEff data binary for GRCh37.75. You can re-create or re-download this dataset using snpEff's `download` command or from the snpEff dataset mirrors.

Notes and recommendations:
- These files were simply removed from the local workspace files to reduce repo weight. The pipeline expects to find executables/data at the same paths (or via the `data/Paths/programs_path`). If you plan to run the pipeline, re-download the required large files and place them under `Programs/` where `Repository.Programs()` expects them, or update the programs_path to point to system-installed versions.
- If you prefer I can instead move these to a separate `heavy_files/` folder inside the repository (gitignored) rather than deleting them outright — tell me and I'll do that instead.

End of list.
