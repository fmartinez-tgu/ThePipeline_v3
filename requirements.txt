# Notes:
# - This `requirements.txt` contains Python packages that can be installed with
#   pip. Many heavy bioinformatics tools (bwa, samtools, bedtools, snp-sites,
#   gatk, varscan, snpEff, etc.) are not pip packages and should be installed
#   via conda/bioconda or downloaded as binaries (see `DEPENDENCIES.txt`).
