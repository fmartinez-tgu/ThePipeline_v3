# Notes:
# - Many system-level bioinformatics tools (bwa, samtools, bedtools, picard,
#   varscan, fastp, kraken, etc.) are easier to install with conda/bioconda and
#   therefore are not duplicated here as pip packages. Use `environment.yml` to
#   install those via conda.
# - GATK (v4.2.5.0) is not included here due to licensing and size; download
#   it manually if you need Mutect2/other GATK tools.pandas==1.3.5
PyVCF==0.6.8

# Notes:
# - This `requirements.txt` contains Python packages that can be installed with
#   pip. Many heavy bioinformatics tools (bwa, samtools, bedtools, snp-sites,
#   gatk, varscan, snpEff, etc.) are not pip packages and should be installed
#   via conda/bioconda or downloaded as binaries (see `DEPENDENCIES.txt`).
